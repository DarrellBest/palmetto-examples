1. Prepare NAMD input files. For this example we will use "alanin" test
case from source code of NAMD package.

2. Inspect job.sh file and adjust the resources and input file 

Note that we are specifying "mpiprocs=1" and add "+ppn 2" in the 
execution line. This part takes care of shared memory parallelism.

3. Submit job using command

qsub job.sh

4. The output has been redirected to "alanin.output"
